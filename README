=== 1. EXECUTION: ===

To compile the program, on the terminal enter the following commands:

	make

To run the program, on the terminal enter the following command:

	./assign4

=== 2. PROGRAM USE: ===

	The initial simulation state can be modified via input.txt.
	
	1  - Restart scene
	Space - Play/pause scene
	
	+  - Increase time step 
	-  - Decrease time step
	W, A, S, D - Translate camera position
	Left Click & Drag - Rotate camera
	C - Reset camera orientation
	
	
=== 3. ALGORITHMS and DESIGN DECISIONS: ===

	Boids are spawned in a sphere of user-specified radius with random headings.  
	Avoidance rule uses inverse weighting, the other rules are linear.  
	Gravity is not implemented.
	Obstacle(sphere) avoidance is implemented the same way as avoiding other boids.
	No acceleration structures implemented.
	There is a min/max velocity enforced such that a boid traveling outside of this bound will have their speed
	increased/decreased by a constant rate.  (Boid.cpp:155)
	Color of the boids change reflects the dominant rule guiding an individual(Red = Avoid, Green = Follow, Blue = Match Velocity).
